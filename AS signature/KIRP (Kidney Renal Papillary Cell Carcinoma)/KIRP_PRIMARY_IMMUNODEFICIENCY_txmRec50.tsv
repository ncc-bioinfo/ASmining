# Column descriptions
# Gene                 : Symbol | ID
# AS_event_type        : RI (Retained intron); A3 (Alternative 3' splice site); A5 (Alternative 5' splice site); 
#                        MX (Mutual exclusive exons); SE (Skipped exon)
# AS_event_ID          : ID in SUPPA2 format 
# Text_mining_gene     : "Observed", when the AS gene is also identified by text-mining analysis; "", otherwise
# AS_event_importance  : Measured as the learned Random Forest (RF) model's feature importance 
#                        (higher, the more important)
# AS_event_correlation : Measured as the spearman's correlation between GSVA scores (degree of pathway enrichment)
#                        and PSI values
# Cancer_recurrence    : Cancer type recurrence (% out of 16 cancer types) of which the AS event shows 
#                        positive feature importance (RF model)
